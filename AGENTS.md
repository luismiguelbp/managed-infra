# managed-infra Agent Guide

This repository contains infrastructure-as-code templates for a small Linux fleet. It is safe to edit templates here, but production inventory, secrets, and tuned configs live outside this repository.

Use this file as the shared guide for AI coding agents. Portable Agent Skills live in `.agents/skills/`; Cursor-specific behavior belongs in `.cursor/rules/` only when needed.

## Templates Only

This repository is **IaC templates**, not production config. Ansible and Docker files here are **not deployed as-is**.

Use fictional names from `ansible/inventory/` in docs, rules, skills, commands, comments, and examples:

| Use | Examples |
|-----|----------|
| Inventory hosts | `edge-node-1`, `edge-node-2`, `edge-node-3` |
| Sites / locations | `site-a`, `site-b`, `site-c` |
| DNS | `edge-node-1.example.lan`, `edge-node-2.example.lan`, `edge-node-3.example.lan` |

Do **not** add real hostnames, real DNS names, real locations, or fleet-specific paths to this repository.

## Two-Repo Model

| Repo | Role |
|------|------|
| `managed-infra` | Playbooks, roles, templates, wrapper scripts, and example inventory |
| `MANAGED_INFRA_CONFIG_SRC` | Real inventory, secrets, production Compose files, and tuned data files |

Production inventory, secrets, credential hashes, and tuned service configs belong in `MANAGED_INFRA_CONFIG_SRC`, which is configured through the gitignored `.env` file.

When **writing or editing files in this repo**, always use the fictional template names above. When **running deploy commands**, host names come from the live inventory under `MANAGED_INFRA_CONFIG_SRC`.

## Security Rules

- Never read, print, echo, commit, or summarize secrets from `.env`, `passwords_file`, credential hashes, or production config files.
- Do not commit backup data, mirrored `.env` files, or runtime service data.
- Keep real host metadata in the external config clone only.
- If a task requires secret values, ask the user to run the sensitive step locally or confirm only non-secret status.

## Setup And Checks

Run commands from the `managed-infra` repo root.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ansible-galaxy collection install -r ansible/requirements.yml
```

Useful verification commands:

```bash
pytest
./bin/infra-list-hosts
./bin/infra-ping
./bin/infra-docker-status
```

## Fleet Scripts

| Goal | Script |
|------|--------|
| List inventory hosts | `./bin/infra-list-hosts` |
| Connectivity check | `./bin/infra-ping` |
| Full fleet provisioning | `./bin/infra-bootstrap` |
| Edge stack only | `./bin/infra-deploy-edge-stack` |
| Configure Samba public share | `./bin/infra-configure-samba` |
| Docker and system status | `./bin/infra-docker-status` |
| Backup edge stack data | `./bin/infra-backup-edge-stack` |
| Restore backup mirror to one host | `./bin/infra-restore-edge-stack` |
| Reboot fleet | `./bin/infra-reboot` |

All scripts accept Ansible extras such as `--limit <host>`, `--check`, and `-e key=value`.

## Operational Guardrails

- Prefer `--limit edge-node-1` or another single host for first production runs or risky changes.
- Run `./bin/infra-list-hosts` before fleet operations so the target set is clear.
- Run `./bin/infra-ping` before deploy, backup, restore, or reboot operations.
- If ping fails, stop and report the failure before running disruptive commands.
- Do not reboot more than one host without confirming the target host list with the user.
- Restores are manual disaster recovery operations and require exactly one target host via `--limit`.
- Compose-only updates should use `./bin/infra-deploy-edge-stack` instead of full bootstrap.

## Portable Skills

Standard Agent Skills are in `.agents/skills/`:

- `infra-fleet`: general managed-infra fleet operations
- `infra-deploy`: full bootstrap workflow
- `infra-status`: fleet health checks
- `infra-backup`: backup mirror workflow
- `infra-restore`: restore mirror workflow
- `infra-reboot`: reboot workflow

Cursor command-style workflows have moved to `.agents/skills/` with `disable-model-invocation: true` where they should be invoked manually.
